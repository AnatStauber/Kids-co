                <div class="info">
                <p class="col-md-11"> Kids&co was founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1969 by David Stevenson and Clark Kent. They began by selling toys, apparel and accessories before deciding that apparel had the most growth potential.

                    By the early 1980s, Kids&co was repositioned as a specialty retailer of children’s apparel for newborns to pre-teens and began offering private label merchandise as well as branded product.
                    
                    Jane Elfers has been President & Chief Executive Officer since 2010. Jane quickly established four Strategic Growth Initiatives for the company to maximize our long-term potential: Superior Product, Business Transformation through Technology, Alternate Channels of Distribution and Fleet Optimization. In order to support our key strategic initiatives, Jane also established a best in class management team and a foundation of operational excellence. Our successful execution of these four Strategic Growth Initiatives have transformed Kids&co from what was a predominately Brick and Mortar North American retailer when Jane arrived, to the Global Best in Class Omni Channel Kids Specialty Retailer that we are today!
                    
                    In 2019, Kids&co purchased the rights to the Gymboree brand and in early 2020, launched product in select stores and online. This iconic brand features colorful designs in playful, bow-to-toe collections that celebrate childhood and help families look their best for any occasion. In late 2021, the Sugar & Jade brand was launched featuring collections tailored to celebrate tween girls’ individuality. In late 2022, the PJ Place brand was launched as a one-stop pajama destination for all ages, including adults. Together, our four brands support growing families across every demographic with apparel that builds confidence and promotes inclusivity.</p>
